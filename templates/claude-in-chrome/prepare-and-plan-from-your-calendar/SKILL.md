# Prepare and plan from your calendar — skill template

Turn this template into a working skill by resolving every `TODO`. The seed prompt
below is the published Anthropic example this template was derived from; your skill
should generalize it for repeated, hands-off use.

## Outcome

Claude in Chrome reads your calendar, pulls context from email threads, flags which meetings need prep, and books rooms for the ones missing them.

TODO: Restate the outcome for YOUR context in one sentence: who runs this, on what
input, producing what artifact, how often.

## Seed prompt (verbatim from source, © Anthropic PBC)

```text
Look at my calendar and help me get ready for tomorrow. For each meeting: Tell me if it's internal or external (check the attendee domains). Find any recent email threads with those attendees about this topic. Flag if the meeting is missing a room (for in-person) or a video link (for remote). If it is, assign one to the meeting. For external meetings, note anything I should review beforehand, like relevant docs attached to the meeting or related emails. Give me a quick prep summary for the day, finding what needs my attention before I show up.
```

## Required context and inputs

- Google Calendar open showing tomorrow's date, logged in
- Gmail open in another tab, logged in
- TODO: exact file paths / folders / message formats this skill should expect
- TODO: domain context the model cannot infer (naming conventions, thresholds, house style)

## Tools, connectors, APIs, and authentication

- Claude in Chrome extension
- Gmail
- Google Calendar
- TODO: confirm which connectors are enabled in the runtime that will execute this skill
- Authentication: connectors authenticate via their own OAuth flows — this skill must
  NEVER ask for, store, or echo credentials, tokens, or API keys. If auth is missing,
  stop and tell the user which connector to enable.

## Permissions and sensitive actions

- Reads: TODO (folders, channels, records this skill may read)
- Writes: TODO (what it may create/modify, and where)
- Held back for the primary agent / human: sending external communications, financial
  transactions, deleting or overwriting originals, submitting web forms, and ANY click that finalizes state on a third-party site (browser-use skill: show a review step first)

## Workflow

1. Describe the task
2. Give Claude context
3. What Claude creates
4. Follow up prompts
5. Tricks, tips, and troubleshooting

TODO: adapt the steps above (from the source page) into imperative instructions for the executing agent, including what to do between steps.

## Decision points

- TODO: list each point where the skill must choose between paths, with the rule to apply
- Default rule: prefer the reversible option; when two readings of the input are
  plausible, surface both rather than picking silently.

## Validation criteria

- Output matches the outcome statement above (spot-check against the seed prompt's asks)
- Every factual claim is traceable to a provided input, connector record, or cited source
- Nothing is submitted/saved on a website without showing the user a review step first
- Site actions limited to the domains named in the workflow
- TODO: add one domain-specific check a reviewer in your org would apply

## Failure modes and fallbacks

- Connector unavailable or unauthenticated → pause, tell the user exactly which connector to enable and why; offer a degraded run from uploaded files
- Page fails to load or selector drifts → retry once, then stop and report; never guess at form fields
- Ambiguous or missing input → ask one targeted question; if unattended, state the assumption inline and proceed
- Any step would take a sensitive/irreversible action → stop and hand back to the user (see Delegation)

## Delegation

Apply the repo's delegation policy (`docs/delegation-policy.md` — bundle or restate
it if you install this skill outside the repo). Defaults for this template:

- Run single-agent unless a step fans out over independent items (files, records,
  vendors, channels). Only independent work parallelizes.
- Each delegated task must ship with: the minimal context slice it needs, an explicit
  output contract, a validation check the primary agent runs on the result, and a
  fallback if it returns empty or fails.
- Final review, synthesis, and every sensitive action listed above stay with the
  primary agent.
- TODO: name the concrete subtasks (if any) that qualify for delegation here.

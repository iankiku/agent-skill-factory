# Build customer personas — skill template

Turn this template into a working skill by resolving every `TODO`. The seed prompt
below is the published Anthropic example this template was derived from; your skill
should generalize it for repeated, hands-off use.

## Outcome

Create personas with demographics, goals, and pain points synthesized from your research data.

TODO: Restate the outcome for YOUR context in one sentence: who runs this, on what
input, producing what artifact, how often.

## Seed prompt (verbatim from source, © Anthropic PBC)

```text
I've uploaded customer feedback from different sources—could be sales call notes, support conversations, survey responses, whatever we've collected. Figure out what types of customers we have based on their actual behavior and problems.

Create an interactive artifact where I can explore each persona and see their journey. Show their goals, what frustrates them, and include actual quotes from customers. Make the artifact professionally and elegantly designed, as it will be shared with others. Focus on creating analytical and helpful content. Take time to analyze thoroughly, outline carefully, and validate your work.
```

## Required context and inputs

- Upload customer research files (sales call notes, interview transcripts, survey responses)
- Optional connectors: HubSpot, Intercom
- Extended Thinking feature enabled
- TODO: exact file paths / folders / message formats this skill should expect
- TODO: domain context the model cannot infer (naming conventions, thresholds, house style)

## Tools, connectors, APIs, and authentication

- HubSpot
- Intercom
- TODO: confirm which connectors are enabled in the runtime that will execute this skill
- Authentication: connectors authenticate via their own OAuth flows — this skill must
  NEVER ask for, store, or echo credentials, tokens, or API keys. If auth is missing,
  stop and tell the user which connector to enable.

## Permissions and sensitive actions

- Reads: TODO (folders, channels, records this skill may read)
- Writes: TODO (what it may create/modify, and where)
- Held back for the primary agent / human: sending external communications, financial
  transactions, deleting or overwriting originals, submitting web forms

## Workflow

1. Describe the task
2. Give Claude context
3. What Claude creates
4. Follow up prompts (create written report, identify revenue opportunity, find quick wins)

TODO: adapt the steps above (from the source page) into imperative instructions for the executing agent, including what to do between steps.

## Decision points

- TODO: list each point where the skill must choose between paths, with the rule to apply
- Default rule: prefer the reversible option; when two readings of the input are
  plausible, surface both rather than picking silently.

## Validation criteria

- Output matches the outcome statement above (spot-check against the seed prompt's asks)
- Every factual claim is traceable to a provided input, connector record, or cited source
- TODO: add one domain-specific check a reviewer in your org would apply

## Failure modes and fallbacks

- Connector unavailable or unauthenticated → pause, tell the user exactly which connector to enable and why; offer a degraded run from uploaded files
- Ambiguous or missing input → ask one targeted question; if unattended, state the assumption inline and proceed
- Any step would take a sensitive/irreversible action → stop and hand back to the user (see Delegation)

## Delegation

Apply the repo's delegation policy (`docs/delegation-policy.md` — bundle or restate
it if you install this skill outside the repo). Defaults for this template:

- Run single-agent unless a step fans out over independent items (files, records,
  vendors, channels). Only independent work parallelizes.
- Each delegated task must ship with: the minimal context slice it needs, an explicit
  output contract, a validation check the primary agent runs on the result, and a
  fallback if it returns empty or fails.
- Final review, synthesis, and every sensitive action listed above stay with the
  primary agent.
- TODO: name the concrete subtasks (if any) that qualify for delegation here.

# Create a company newsletter — skill template

Turn this template into a working skill by resolving every `TODO`. The seed prompt
below is the published Anthropic example this template was derived from; your skill
should generalize it for repeated, hands-off use.

## Outcome

Stay informed with a publication-style digest that synthesizes company news from all your channels.

TODO: Restate the outcome for YOUR context in one sentence: who runs this, on what
input, producing what artifact, how often.

## Seed prompt (verbatim from source, © Anthropic PBC)

```text
Create a weekly digest for Oct 14-20 for my company. Pull information from relevant channels in my Slack, such as #company-announcements, #product-updates, #leadership, and any other channels where major decisions happened. Include data visualizations where useful. Use a dense but readable layout. Pack information efficiently and use sophisticated typography and spacing. Go for a British newspaper aesthetic: no gradients, shadows, rounded corners, or bright colors. Print-like typography with tight leading. Include institutional publishing elements—standfirsts, pull quotes with left borders, desk attributions, sourced charts using Chart.js. This should look hand-crafted by an editorial designer. Include substantive developments formatted like a real publication I'd read on Sunday evening.
```

## Required context and inputs

- Enable Slack connector
- Enable Google Drive integration
- Enable Gmail integration
- Enable Extended Thinking feature
- TODO: exact file paths / folders / message formats this skill should expect
- TODO: domain context the model cannot infer (naming conventions, thresholds, house style)

## Tools, connectors, APIs, and authentication

- Gmail
- Google Drive
- Slack
- TODO: confirm which connectors are enabled in the runtime that will execute this skill
- Authentication: connectors authenticate via their own OAuth flows — this skill must
  NEVER ask for, store, or echo credentials, tokens, or API keys. If auth is missing,
  stop and tell the user which connector to enable.

## Permissions and sensitive actions

- Reads: TODO (folders, channels, records this skill may read)
- Writes: TODO (what it may create/modify, and where)
- Held back for the primary agent / human: sending external communications, financial
  transactions, deleting or overwriting originals, submitting web forms

## Workflow

1. Describe the task
2. Give Claude context (enable required integrations)
3. Claude creates the digest output
4. Follow up with additional prompts to expand or refine

TODO: adapt the steps above (from the source page) into imperative instructions for the executing agent, including what to do between steps.

## Decision points

- TODO: list each point where the skill must choose between paths, with the rule to apply
- Default rule: prefer the reversible option; when two readings of the input are
  plausible, surface both rather than picking silently.

## Validation criteria

- Output matches the outcome statement above (spot-check against the seed prompt's asks)
- Every factual claim is traceable to a provided input, connector record, or cited source
- TODO: add one domain-specific check a reviewer in your org would apply

## Failure modes and fallbacks

- Connector unavailable or unauthenticated → pause, tell the user exactly which connector to enable and why; offer a degraded run from uploaded files
- Ambiguous or missing input → ask one targeted question; if unattended, state the assumption inline and proceed
- Any step would take a sensitive/irreversible action → stop and hand back to the user (see Delegation)

## Delegation

Apply the repo's delegation policy (`docs/delegation-policy.md` — bundle or restate
it if you install this skill outside the repo). Defaults for this template:

- Run single-agent unless a step fans out over independent items (files, records,
  vendors, channels). Only independent work parallelizes.
- Each delegated task must ship with: the minimal context slice it needs, an explicit
  output contract, a validation check the primary agent runs on the result, and a
  fallback if it returns empty or fails.
- Final review, synthesis, and every sensitive action listed above stay with the
  primary agent.
- TODO: name the concrete subtasks (if any) that qualify for delegation here.
